# Minesweeper-AI

This project explores strategies to play the Minesweeper game effectively by leveraging various Artificial Intelligence algorithms. The project involves the identification and implementation of suitable algorithms to enhance Minesweeper gameplay. 

The primary algorithm discussed in the paper is designed to intelligently uncover mine locations. Additionally, the project considers potential future improvements based on the outcomes of this research and insights from other related studies. This work was conducted during an Artificial Intelligence course as a group project in the academic year 2023/2024 at the American University of Armenia.

For instructions how to run the project please read "Minesweeper Game.md" and "Minesweeper Game with Oppie and Urchie.md" files.

Thanks and see you later.
